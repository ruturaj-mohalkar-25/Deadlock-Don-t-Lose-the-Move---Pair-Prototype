/// hits you). Written naively - one coroutine per effect, each restoring timeScale = 1 -
/// the first to finish cancels the second. Worse, if a coroutine's GameObject is destroyed
/// mid-effect (a turret dying during its own hitstop) the coroutine dies with it and the
/// game stays frozen for the rest of the run.
///
/// Longest freeze wins. Unscaled clock so a scale-0 freeze can still end.
/// Tick() is driven from LevelManager, which never dies.
