# LOCKDOWN

**A 60-second arena shooter where getting shot doesn't cost you health — it costs you a direction.**

Take a hit and one of your four movement directions is taken away. Lose *Left* and the A key
simply stops working. The bullet that hits you decides which one you lose, so you don't get to
choose. Survive a full minute to win.

## Controls

| | |
|---|---|
| **WASD** / **Arrow keys** | Move |
| **Mouse** | Aim |
| **Left click** | Shoot |
| **R** | Restart |

Aiming is independent of movement — you can always shoot in a direction you can no longer
walk in.

## Losing a direction

Every bullet that lands takes one heart **and** one direction. Which direction depends on the
angle the bullet was travelling: you lose the one pointing back toward where it came from, so
getting shot from the left takes away your ability to move left, into the shot.

Your four directions are the coloured fins on your ship, and the arrows in the top-left
corner:

| Direction | Colour |
|---|---|
| Up | Blue |
| Down | Red |
| Left | Yellow |
| Right | Green |

When an arrow greys out, that key is dead.

## Getting it back

Losing a direction drops a **coloured orb** somewhere in the arena. Touch it and that
direction comes straight back.

You have **15 seconds** before the orb burns out — watch the ring around it shrink. Let it
expire and that direction is gone for the rest of the run.

The catch: the orb tends to land in the direction you just lost. The one place you need to
reach is the one place you can't walk in a straight line to, so you have to go the long way
round — out in the open, with three turrets watching.

**If all four directions go at once**, you're frozen solid. Hold on for two seconds and the
game hands one back. It's the only thing standing between you and a soft lock, and it will
keep doing it — but the turrets don't stop firing while you wait.

## What's shooting at you

**Turrets** — three of them, bolted to the corners of the arena. Each one glows for half a
second before it fires, and it commits to where you were standing when the glow started.
**That glow is your dodge window.** Step aside in time and the shot sails past.

They die in a single hit, but they come back, and they come back faster as the clock runs
down.

**Bullets** bounce once off a wall before they die, so a shot that misses you can still swing
round and catch you on the way back. Watch for the ones that turn hollow — those have already
bounced and they're coming from a direction you weren't looking.

You can **shoot bullets out of the air.** When you're down a direction and can't dodge, that's
often the only answer left.

**The crawler** patrols the middle of the arena. It cannot be killed and it does not take
hearts — it just kills you, instantly, on contact. Treat it as a moving wall, not an enemy.

---

## The clock is the difficulty

Nothing gets easier. Every ten seconds the arena tightens:

- turrets fire faster
- turrets respawn faster
- the crawler gets quicker — it starts slow enough to ignore and ends up nearly as fast as you

The last ten seconds are meant to be survived, not controlled.

---

## Winning and losing

**Survive 60 seconds** and you win. Take **five hits** and you're dead — or touch the crawler
once, which skips straight to the end no matter how many hearts you had left.

Hearts and directions are different things. Collecting orbs will keep you moving, but nothing
gives your hearts back.
